i is the name of the loop variable. */ means every subdirectory of the current directory, and will include a trailing slash in those names. 
Make sure you cd to the right place before executing this. "$i" simply names that directory, including trailing slash. 
The quotation marks ensure that whitespace in the directory name won't cause trouble. 
${i%/} is like $i but with the trailing slash removed, so you can use that to construct the name of the zip file.
